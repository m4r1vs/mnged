## Getting started
To try it on your own run the following commands after you installed [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/):
```sh
yarn
yarn start
```
If you don't have [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/) installed, go ahead and do it. It's definitely worth it ;)
If you have [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm), you also should run `nvm use v8` to use node version 8.X.X
